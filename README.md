# Triplet Telehealth
This site was designed for the 2020 Telemedicine Challenge hosted by the New York Academy of Sciences. The project uses the cholera outbreak in Yemen as a case study for how an online platform can integrate education, treatment distribution, and telemedicine in a rural area. 

## Contributors
The project was completed by 6 brilliant students, divided into 3 subgroups.

The technology team oversaw the development and implementation of the online platform. The treatment and education teams provided the content used on the site.
